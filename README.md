# matrixLab
C++ libraries to solve fundamental matrix functions
matrixLab primarily constitutes of 5 different libraries
1. vector.h to handle all vector operations
2. matrix.h to handle all matrix operations
3. crammer.h to solve a set of linear equations
4. orthogonalization.h to orthogonalize a matrix
5. eigen.h to find eigen values of a matrix and upper triangular matrix 5
